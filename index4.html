<h1>Zombies</h1>

<p>One of my favourite game modes on black ops 3, this game mode is a very rich in
  story, amazing mechanics, and one of the best graphics games on the market.

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>The story of Zombies in the call of duty games has been going on for 8 years, since world at war
  the rich story has lead the main characters to different parts of the universe to try and stop the
  zombie epidemic. The story is interesting though, because to find it you have to do
  secret hidden things to start certain things that let you get to parts that reveal the
  story, these are called easter eggs. A tutorial of how to complete one of them on my favourite map
  is below.<br>
