<h2>What is competitive call of duty?</h2>
<p>Well like any other large competitive events, they are sponsored by large companies such
  as the Call of Duty company, or some others like MLG or some other smaller ones. but they
  ussually work how any sport would, they do tryouts to see who is worth playing in the event.
  then, it acts like a ladder system till the point of where 2 teams face off to battle it out
  for a very large prize. in the 2015 call of duty championships the winners won 1 million dollars.
